* Bugs!!
1. When embeding a WADL in a docbook, the order of the methods should
   appear as they are listed in the DocBook document.  For example:
   
   <resource href="os-bs.wadl#VolumeInstance">
     <method href="updateVolume"/>
     <method href="getVolume"/>
     <method href="deleteVolume"/>
   </resource>

   Here, updateVolume method should be documented before the getVolume
   method and that should come before the deleteVolume method.
   Currently the source WADL (os-bs.wadl) order is used which is
   wrong.
2. Samples should be relative to the document where they are placed.
   For example if wadl1 loads wadl2 and wadl2 is in a seperate
   directory relative sample paths should be rosolved from wadl2 if
   they are listed in that wadl.
